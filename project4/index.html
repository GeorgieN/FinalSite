Hi. This is <a href="about.html"> Georgie Nolan's</a>
2019 Wintersession Web Design Archive. During this course I made many things that I want to share with you. You should see this <a href="exercises/excercise1/index.html" target="_blank">this poster I made</a>. Here you can see some <a href=".../project1/index.html" target="_blank">lyrics that I styled</a>. You can try to <a href="../project2/index.html" target="_blank">load this page</a>. You can even <a href="../project3/index.html" target="_blank">dress me</a> in some of my favourite looks from fashion weeks this year. You can see some of my working process sketches <a href="process.html">here</a>. I also did some <a href="readings.html">writing</a> about the current state of the world wide web.<br> Thanks for visiting this site.</br> It was made just for you by me!<br>Georgie Nolan from the RISD MFA Program
