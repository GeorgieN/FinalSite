      <h1> 1. Paul Ford, What is Code? & Frank Chimero, What Screens Want</h1>

      <h2>What Screens Want</h2>
  <p>Reading through the articles this week, I was reminded of thoughts I’ve had in the past surrounding the close relationship that society and it’s evolution has with the development of digital technology and the internet.

Chimero’s artcle “What Screens Want” talks about how the evolution of our digital devices is able to be tracked alongside our tolerance to digest their capabilities using a skeuomorphic process.
I think in the same way that this technology has evolved to mirror what is happening in the physical world we live in - our everyday lives have changed to reflect what is happening online in a similar way.

For example with graphic design - let’s take signage in particular. Shop signs in the early 2000s reflected similar styles to what was available on the internet and to designers at the time. These days, we are conditioned to trust and look for signage that reflects the style of aesthetics we see online just the same. This is one of the reasons I think that as much as organisation and this use of “flux” that Chimero talks about is occurring in the digital space, it is also occurring in a similar way in our physical world. For instance, many companies are looking to offer streamlined and accessible experiences to their staff/clients/customers in physical environments.

So taking that into account, I think that reimagining the “map” of the internet would also mean to reimagine the world in general because the two are so interlinked.</p>

<h2>What is Code?</h2>

<p>I feel that articles like Paul Ford’s “What is Code” is a step into a direction of more clarity and understanding around the computer and it’s capabilities. I think that explaining and unpacking the mystery of computers, code and the internet will help us move into a place where knowledge is more accessible and we won’t need to create the smoke and mirrors and “flux” to help people to better understand the world they are living in. For the same reason that Chimero explains that creating more intuitive designs means people spend less time interacting with that software.</p>

        <h1>2. Olia Lialina, Vernacular Web 1 & Alexander R. Galloway, Jodi's Infrastructure</h1>

<h2>Vernacular Web 1</h2>

<p>Reading ‘A Vernacular Web’ made me cringe a little bit. It was interesting to read about what it was like to be a designer during that era of the web, I still remember the aesthetic so clearly. There is definitely a nostalgia for the early imagery and kistchy vibes from the late 90s (not just in web design) but I feel like I’m ready to move on and I think considering when this article was published.. we should. However, I do agree that this sense of freedom and a personal and individual presence is something that the internet today lacks. We have allowed the online space to become a reflection of what we see in our everyday physical environments. It is unfortunate that the smaller players can’t complete with the big tech companies on gaining our attention because of SEOs and huge amounts of advertising.
It does feel like an entirely different time when the internet was a place of expressing yourself and having the freedom to share your unique experience and be connected.</p>

<h2>Jodi's Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Starting off with a reading about the early days of amateur web design and then moving onto the future possibilities of the medium was a nice pairing.
In the same way that we can look back at the nostalgia for the design features of the early web. I also remember my first interactions with code - not that I knew it at the time.I discovered from reading this article that I knew more about Unicode and ASCII than I thought and remembered when everyone used characters like “ (·̀‸·́)   Kίттεη   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ “ on instant messaging in early highschool.
I was surprised while reading ‘’Jodi’s Infrastructure’ that they were questioning whether working within this medium was art or not. I think that the term “digital artist” is something that has been around for some time. Though, I am always interested to hear opinions about what “art” means. I think it will be interesting to see where this internet medium goes in the future as the capabilities of the internet become more advanced.</p></div>

        <h1>3. Samuel Earle, Capitalism vs. Privacy & Louise Drulhe, Critical Atlas of Internet</h1>

         <h2>Capitalism vs privacy:</h2>

<p>Reading Earle’s essay added to my point of view on the conversations around online privacy and I found the articles arguments very convincing. It was interesting as he points out, that this it not an uncommon trend “Corporations and states historically have shared interests and work together for mutual gain. This happens regardless of moral principles”. I think people are quick to think that this is somehow a different conversation because on one hand, we put our information out there to be taken and don’t necessarily take responsibility for our own privacy, still under the assumption that the internet is a place for “freedom”. But I think in this case, let’s take the recent events with Facebook, there is so much data harvested that we aren’t aware of and I don’t think broader society realised how severe the consequences might be. However, even now, when I feel as though people online are more concerned about privacy, I don’t see much being done outside the court rooms, nor can I think of ways yet to help in dealing with some of these really serious issues.</p>

<h2>Critical atlas of the internet:</h2>

<p>This article was a surprising read. Both in it’s content and design. I enjoyed the idea of trying to visualise something which we see as this intangible, magical cloud. If we think about how the internet is structured, it does have so much to do with each of our unique footprints and experiences. This article encouraged me to think about how wide and deep the internet is and that most of us will only ever access its most surface capabilities. I also began to think about how much the internet plays a role in each of our lives and yet it is something which is so hard to attribute a physical value. I think in connection to the readings around ‘Capitalism vs Privacy’, we don’t think about the economic capabilities and monetisation of the internet because we struggle so much to understand the space that we exist within it to begin with.
On another note - I’m not entirely sure why the author chose such an elaborate typeface for the article - but I would love to ask them.

<h1>4. Doc Searls and David Weinberger, New Clues</h1>

         <p>I found Doc Searls and David Weinberger’s manifesto an interesting yet uncomfortable read. I understand that the intended audience is most likely people who are new to these concepts and that Searls and Weinberger want to engage them, though it came off more irritating than anything else and far too commanding. The placement of the article within the Wired site was curious too as the webpage is bursting with advertisements which I felt, dampened the impact of the statements.
Despite this, the manifesto overall highlighted some important revelations about the possibilities of what the internet can be and that not all hope is lost and that it can be “reclaimed”. I thought about this when I read the previous articles about mapping the web and the idea that most of us will never use it in its full capability. It was refreshing to have it pointed out that the internet is more than what it is currently being used for but my question is how should we discover it and that wherever there is interest, you can be sure that the big tech companies will be on their way to make a profit.
I was disappointed that Searl and Weinberger didn’t offer us any solutions to the issues we have as “the People of the Internet”. </p></div>
